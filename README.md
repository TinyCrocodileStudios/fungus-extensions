# fungus-extensions
We love to work with fungus and like to share some additional code with you.

Fungus is an open source visual storytelling tool for Unity, developed by snozbot (https://snozbot.itch.io/).

Here we want to share some code that you can put in your Unity project to extend fungus.

---

Assuming you already have Fungus installed, follow those easy steps:

1. Download the folder
2. Put the folder somewhere in your Unity project folder hierarchy.
3. Use Fungus 
4. Find new commands under the Tab "Tiny Crocodile Studios"
5. Enjoy!

P.S.: I added the script "StartBlockInFungusOnMouseOver.cs" which is not exactly a fungus extension, but a script which lets you start a fungus block when the mouse hovers over an object with a collider attached. Find steps to use inside the script!
